# Rawgher's Recipes

## Application Description
This is an application that I made using a code along as a template. I wanted to create a recipe storage site for myself using what I had learned
in some rails tutorial videos. It was a fun project and there were points where I pushed myself to deviate from the code along more than I was
prepared for at the time, but with some googling I was able to figure out where my new errors were coming from.
